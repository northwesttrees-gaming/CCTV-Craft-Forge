# About CCTV Craft
Whether you want to spy on your friend's house on a server or keep an eye on your village, CCTV Craft will provide you the tools to watch whatever you want anywhere you want. We have used MCreator to make this complex mod from the ground up. NorthWestTrees Gaming maintains the mod. We currently have limited features but plan to add more content and release stable builds as the development goes on.

### March 08, 2024 - What Happens After 4.9.0
So let's talk about what will happen to the Forge version for the mod. 
MCreator will be porting to NeoForge which will by proxy make newer mods port to that platform.
Though this is for sure a major change there is still unfinished work here to be done.
I want to make sure the last releases for Forge 1.19.4 and 1.20.1 are relatively stable before moving on and developing for NeoForge.  
  
I know this has become a major mod in the community so I want to at least make sure that this platform version has a good final build.
With this being said though after 4.9.0 it will be mainly optimizations and no new features. I wanted to get entity drones in with this platform but sadly it won't be a reality at least on Minecraft Forge, NeoForge I will still be aiming to release entity drones like the plans were for Forge but it will require more time and testing something I don't have if I want to push out a few optimizations for this platform.

So what will 4.8 and 4.9 bring?  
The core features for this update are taking some time to do as I had to roll back the mod but they are listed below.
- [x] Config file for ore distribution.
- [ ] Better Forge Tage Support
- [ ] Reintroduce sound blocks and alarms.

And 4.10 and 4.11 will be for:
- [ ] Attempt at optimization for TPS.

After 4.11 the mod will be finished for the Forge platform.  
  
I will focus my attention on remaking many of the features in the CCTVCraft forge version for NEoForge which will give me an easier time to monitor and improve the mechanics of the mod from day one.
